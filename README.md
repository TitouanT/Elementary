# Elementary
Here I share some script I made for elementaryOS. 


To use the scirpt of that folder you have to add them into the bin folder of your home ( maybe you have to create it ).
You have to make them executable :

```shell
$ chmod u+x script.sh
```

And then you can make them execute automaticly by using that :

```shell
$ gnome-session-properties
```
